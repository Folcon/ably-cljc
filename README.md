# ably-cljc

## What is this?

Is this a proper ably lib? Not really, it's a thin wrapper around ably's java classes with just enough functionality for me to write the code that I'm working on.

If anything it's an example of how to use something like ably from clojure.

Perhaps someday it will be something more.
